# ios_xr_textfsm
Showcasing some of the testfsm files I designed to parse Cisco IOS XR cli outputs  

Note: Due to sample outputs limitations, design goals, and the complexity that comes with potential variability of some of the cli outputs when these parsers were designed, some of them are incomplete.
